# edza-security-cam
Edza security cam clicks a picture everytime a person/face is detected and saves the picture along with the time it was taken and then uploads it to the cloud/local server.
This project was created as I didn't have enough storage for a recording my security footage 24/7. This is a much cheaper altenative and can be tweaked to use with multiple ip cameras. I use this with a raspberry pi but you can use other boards.
